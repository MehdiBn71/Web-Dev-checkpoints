Algorithm SentenceAnalysis

Variables:
  length, words, vowels : integer
  sentence : string
  char : character

Begin
  Read(sentence)   // the sentence ends with '.'
  
  length ← 0
  words ← 1        // words = spaces + 1
  vowels ← 0

  For i ← 1 to length(sentence) Do
      char ← sentence[i]
      length ← length + 1

      If char = ' ' Then
         words ← words + 1
      EndIf

      If char ∈ {a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U} Then
         vowels ← vowels + 1
      EndIf
  EndFor

  Write("Length of the sentence = ", length)
  Write("Number of words = ", words)
  Write("Number of vowels = ", vowels)

End
